# 3D Configurator Web-App

## What is this?

mMod is a Tool to prepare and edit a 3D-Model in the Browser.

The `Inventor Addin` helps you marking parameters in an Inventor model and then export it as a jsCad-File.

Then, this File can be added to this [Folder](Web-App/src/scripts/jscad_scripts). The `Web-App` will include your model in the Select-Dropdown menu.

For further information see the seperate folders.
